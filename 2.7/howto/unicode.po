"In 1968, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, better "
"known by its acronym ASCII, was standardized.  ASCII defined numeric codes "
"for various characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127.  For "
"example, the lowercase letter 'a' is assigned 97 as its code value."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/unicode.rst:24
msgid ""
"ASCII was an American-developed standard, so it only defined unaccented "
"characters.  There was an 'e', but no 'é' or 'Í'.  This meant that languages "
"which required accented characters couldn't be faithfully represented in "
"ASCII. (Actually the missing accents matter for English, too, which contains "
"words such as 'naïve' and 'café', and some publications have house styles "
"which require spellings such as 'coöperate'.)"

"In the 1980s, almost all personal computers were 8-bit, meaning that bytes "
"could hold values ranging from 0 to 255.  ASCII codes only went up to 127, "
"so some machines assigned values between 128 and 255 to accented "
"characters.  Different machines had different codes, however, which led to "
"problems exchanging files. Eventually various commonly used sets of values "
"for the 128-255 range emerged. Some were true standards, defined by the "
"International Standards Organization, and some were **de facto** conventions "
"that were invented by one company or another and managed to catch on."

"Unicode started out using 16-bit characters instead of 8-bit characters.  16 "

"every single human language. It turns out that even 16 bits isn't enough to "

"A **character** is the smallest possible component of a text.  'A', 'B', "

"Strictly, these definitions imply that it's meaningless to say 'this is "

"To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code "
"points, which are numbers from 0 to 0x10ffff.  This sequence needs to be "
"represented as a set of bytes (meaning, values from 0-255) in memory.  The "

"an **encoding**."

"It's very wasteful of space.  In most texts, the majority of the code points "

"Latin-1, also known as ISO-8859-1, is a similar encoding.  Unicode code "

"Unicode strings are expressed as instances of the :class:`unicode` type, one "

"called :class:`basestring`, which is also an ancestor of the :class:`str` "
"type; you can therefore check if a value is a string type with "
"``isinstance(value, basestring)``.  Under the hood, Python represents "
"Unicode strings as either 16- or 32-bit integers, depending on how the "
"Python interpreter was compiled."
msgstr ""

"The :func:`unicode` constructor has the signature ``unicode(string[, "
"encoding, errors])``.  All of its arguments should be 8-bit strings.  The "
"first argument is converted to Unicode using the specified encoding; if you "

"conversion, so characters greater than 127 will be treated as errors::"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/unicode.rst:262

"The ``errors`` argument specifies the response when the input string can't "
"be converted according to the encoding's rules.  Legal values for this "
"argument are 'strict' (raise a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` exception), "
"'replace' (add U+FFFD, 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER'), or 'ignore' (just leave the "
"character out of the Unicode result).  The following examples show the "
"differences::"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/unicode.rst:278

"Encodings are specified as strings containing the encoding's name.  Python "
"2.7 comes with roughly 100 different encodings; see the Python Library "
"Reference at :ref:`standard-encodings` for a list.  Some encodings have "
"multiple names; for example, 'latin-1', 'iso_8859_1' and '8859' are all "
"synonyms for the same encoding."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/unicode.rst:284
msgid ""
"One-character Unicode strings can also be created with the :func:`unichr` "
"built-in function, which takes integers and returns a Unicode string of "
"length 1 that contains the corresponding code point.  The reverse operation "

"string and returns the code point value::"
msgstr ""

"Instances of the :class:`unicode` type have many of the same methods as the "

msgid ""
"Note that the arguments to these methods can be Unicode strings or 8-bit "

"Another important method is ``.encode([encoding], [errors='strict'])``, "
"which returns an 8-bit string version of the Unicode string, encoded in the "

"similarly parallel to the standard function's parameter.  ``encoding`` is a "
"string giving the encoding to use; if it's left as ``None``, a regular "
"Python file object that accepts 8-bit strings is returned.  Otherwise, a "
"wrapper object is returned, and data written to or read from the wrapper "
"object will be converted as needed. ``errors`` specifies the action for "
"encoding errors and can be one of the usual values of 'strict', 'ignore', "

"Unicode character U+FEFF is used as a byte-order mark (BOM), and is often "

"used, the BOM will be automatically written as the first character and will "
"be silently dropped when the file is read.  There are variants of these "

"configurable encoding; on Windows, Python uses the name \"mbcs\" to refer to "

"If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and 8-"
"bit strings, you will find your program vulnerable to bugs wherever you "
"combine the two different kinds of strings.  Python's default encoding is "

"When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a "
"common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using "
"the string in a generated command line or storing it in a database.  If "
"you're doing this, be careful to check the string once it's in the form that "
"will be used or stored; it's possible for encodings to be used to disguise "
"characters.  This is especially true if the input data also specifies the "
"encoding; many encodings leave the commonly checked-for characters alone, "
"but Python includes some encodings such as ``'base64'`` that modify every "
"single character."
