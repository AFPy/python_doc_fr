"These routines allow C code to work with serialized objects using the same "
"data format as the :mod:`marshal` module.  There are functions to write data "
"into the serialization format, and additional functions that can be used to "
"read the data back.  Files used to store marshalled data must be opened in "
"binary mode."

"The module supports two versions of the data format: version 0 is the "
"historical version, version 1 (new in Python 2.4) shares interned strings in "
"the file, and upon unmarshalling.  Version 2 (new in Python 2.5) uses a "
"binary format for floating point numbers.  *Py_MARSHAL_VERSION* indicates "
"the current file format (currently 2)."

"there's no error.  What's the right way to tell? Should only non-negative "
"values be written using these routines?"
