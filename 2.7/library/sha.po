"This module implements the interface to NIST's secure hash  algorithm, known "
"as SHA-1.  SHA-1 is an improved version of the original SHA hash algorithm.  "
"It is used in the same way as the :mod:`md5` module: use :func:`new` to "
"create an sha object, then feed this object with arbitrary strings using "
"the :meth:`update` method, and at any point you can ask it for the :dfn:"
"`digest` of the concatenation of the strings fed to it so far.  SHA-1 "
"digests are 160 bits instead of MD5's 128 bits."
