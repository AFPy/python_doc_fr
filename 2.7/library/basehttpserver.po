"This module defines two classes for implementing HTTP servers (Web servers). "
"Usually, this module isn't used directly, but is used as a basis for "
"building functioning Web servers. See the :mod:`SimpleHTTPServer` and :mod:"
"`CGIHTTPServer` modules."

msgid ""
"The first class, :class:`HTTPServer`, is a :class:`SocketServer.TCPServer` "
"subclass, and therefore implements the :class:`SocketServer.BaseServer` "
"interface.  It creates and listens at the HTTP socket, dispatching the "
"requests to a handler.  Code to create and run the server looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/basehttpserver.rst:44
msgid ""
"This class builds on the :class:`TCPServer` class by storing the server "
"address as instance variables named :attr:`server_name` and :attr:"
"`server_port`. The server is accessible by the handler, typically through "
"the handler's :attr:`server` instance variable."
msgstr ""

"This class is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the server. By "
"itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests; it must be subclassed "
"to handle each request method (e.g. GET or POST). :class:"

"and methods for use by subclasses."

"The handler will parse the request and the headers, then call a method "
"specific to the request type. The method name is constructed from the "
"request. For example, for the request method ``SPAM``, the :meth:`do_SPAM` "
"method will be called with no arguments. All of the relevant information is "
"stored in instance variables of the handler.  Subclasses should not need to "
"override or extend the :meth:`__init__` method."
