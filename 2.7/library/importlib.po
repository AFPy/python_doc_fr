"Import a module. The *name* argument specifies what module to import in "
"absolute or relative terms (e.g. either ``pkg.mod`` or ``..mod``). If the "
"name is specified in relative terms, then the *package* argument must be "
"specified to the package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the "
"package name (e.g. ``import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')`` will import "
"``pkg.mod``).  The specified module will be inserted into :data:`sys."
