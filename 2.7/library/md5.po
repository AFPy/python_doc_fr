"This module implements the interface to RSA's MD5 message digest  algorithm "
"(see also Internet :rfc:`1321`).  Its use is quite straightforward: use :"
"func:`new` to create an md5 object. You can now feed this object with "
"arbitrary strings using the :meth:`update` method, and at any point you can "
"ask it for the :dfn:`digest` (a strong kind of 128-bit checksum, a.k.a. "
"\"fingerprint\") of the concatenation of the strings fed to it so far using "
"the :meth:`digest` method."
