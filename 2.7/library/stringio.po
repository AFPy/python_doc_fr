"This module implements a file-like class, :class:`StringIO`, that reads and "
"writes a string buffer (also known as *memory files*).  See the description "
"of file objects for operations (section :ref:`bltin-file-objects`). (For "
"standard strings, see :class:`str` and :class:`unicode`.)"

"When a :class:`StringIO` object is created, it can be initialized to an "
"existing string by passing the string to the constructor. If no string is "
"given, the :class:`StringIO` will start empty. In both cases, the initial "
"file position starts at zero."

"The :class:`StringIO` object can accept either Unicode or 8-bit strings, but "
"mixing the two may take some care.  If both are used, 8-bit strings that "
"cannot be interpreted as 7-bit ASCII (that use the 8th bit) will cause a :"
"exc:`UnicodeError` to be raised when :meth:`getvalue` is called."

"Retrieve the entire contents of the \"file\" at any time before the :class:"
"`StringIO` object's :meth:`close` method is called.  See the note above for "

"The module :mod:`cStringIO` provides an interface similar to that of the :"
"mod:`StringIO` module.  Heavy use of :class:`StringIO.StringIO` objects can "

"Since this is a factory function which returns objects of built-in types, "
"there's no way to build your own version using subclassing.  It's not "
"possible to set attributes on it.  Use the original :mod:`StringIO` module "
"in those cases."

"Another difference from the :mod:`StringIO` module is that calling :func:"
"`StringIO` with a string parameter creates a read-only object. Unlike an "
"object created without a string parameter, it does not have write methods. "
"These objects are not generally visible.  They turn up in tracebacks as :"
