"A :class:`netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data from  a "
"netrc file.  The initialization argument, if present, specifies the file to "
"parse.  If no argument is given, the file :file:`.netrc` in the user's home "
"directory will be read.  Parse errors will raise :exc:`NetrcParseError` with "
"diagnostic information including the file name, line number, and terminating "
"token. If no argument is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of "
"passwords in the :file:`.netrc` file will raise a :exc:`NetrcParseError` if "
"the file ownership or permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than "
"the user running the process, or accessible for read or write by any other "
"user). This implements security behavior equivalent to that of ftp and other "
"programs that use :file:`.netrc`."
