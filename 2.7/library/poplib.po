"This module defines a class, :class:`POP3`, which encapsulates a connection "
"to a POP3 server and implements the protocol as defined in :rfc:`1725`.  "
"The :class:`POP3` class supports both the minimal and optional command sets. "
"Additionally, this module provides a class :class:`POP3_SSL`, which provides "
"support for connecting to POP3 servers that use SSL as an underlying "
"protocol layer."

"mailserver supports IMAP, you would be better off using the :class:`imaplib."
