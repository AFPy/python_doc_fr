"This module provides constants which represent the numeric values of "
"internal nodes of the parse tree.  Unlike most Python constants, these use "
"lower-case names.  Refer to the file :file:`Grammar/Grammar` in the Python "
"distribution for the definitions of the names in the context of the language "
"grammar.  The specific numeric values which the names map to may change "
"between Python versions."
