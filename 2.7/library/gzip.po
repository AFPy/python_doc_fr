"The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class which is modeled "

"the data so that it looks like an ordinary file object."

"Constructor for the :class:`GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the "
"methods of a file object, with the exception of the :meth:`readinto` and :"
"meth:`truncate` methods.  At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be "
"given a non-trivial value."

"The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, "
"a :class:`~StringIO.StringIO` object, or any other object which simulates a "
"file.  It defaults to ``None``, in which case *filename* is opened to "
"provide a file object."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/gzip.rst:40
msgid ""
"When *fileobj* is not ``None``, the *filename* argument is only used to be "
"included in the :program:`gzip` file header, which may include the original "
"filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of "
"*fileobj*, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and "
"in this case the original filename is not included in the header."

"The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``, "

"written.  The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, "
"the default is ``'rb'``. If not given, the 'b' flag will be added to the "
"mode to ensure the file is opened in binary mode for cross-platform "
"portability."

"The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``0`` to ``9`` controlling "
"the level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least "
"compression, and ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression. ``0`` "
"is no compression. The default is ``9``."

"The *mtime* argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written to the "
"stream when compressing.  All :program:`gzip` compressed streams are "
"required to contain a timestamp.  If omitted or ``None``, the current time "
"is used.  This module ignores the timestamp when decompressing; however, "
"some programs, such as :program:`gunzip`\\ , make use of it. The format of "
"the timestamp is the same as that of the return value of ``time.time()`` and "
"of the ``st_mtime`` attribute of the object returned by ``os.stat()``."

"Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`close` method does not close "
