msgid ""
"The :mod:`cgitb` module provides a special exception handler for Python "
"scripts. (Its name is a bit misleading.  It was originally designed to "
"display extensive traceback information in HTML for CGI scripts.  It was "
"later generalized to also display this information in plain text.)  After "
"this module is activated, if an uncaught exception occurs, a detailed, "
"formatted report will be displayed.  The report includes a traceback showing "
"excerpts of the source code for each level, as well as the values of the "
"arguments and local variables to currently running functions, to help you "
"debug the problem.  Optionally, you can save this information to a file "
"instead of sending it to the browser."

"The optional argument *display* defaults to ``1`` and can be set to ``0`` to "
"suppress sending the traceback to the browser. If the argument *logdir* is "
"present, the traceback reports are written to files.  The value of *logdir* "
"should be a directory where these files will be placed. The optional "
"argument *context* is the number of lines of context to display around the "
"current line of source code in the traceback; this defaults to ``5``. If the "
"optional argument *format* is ``\"html\"``, the output is formatted as "
"HTML.  Any other value forces plain text output.  The default value is ``"
"\"html\"``."

"This function handles an exception using the default settings (that is, show "
"a report in the browser, but don't log to a file). This can be used when "
"you've caught an exception and want to report it using :mod:`cgitb`.  The "
"optional *info* argument should be a 3-tuple containing an exception type, "
"exception value, and traceback object, exactly like the tuple returned by :"
"func:`sys.exc_info`.  If the *info* argument is not supplied, the current "
"exception is obtained from :func:`sys.exc_info`."
