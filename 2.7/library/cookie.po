"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the :rfc:"
"`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered that "
"MSIE 3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs and "
"also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when "
"comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit "
"less strict."
