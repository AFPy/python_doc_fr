"descriptors and Apple Event object specifiers."

msgid ""
"Apple Event data is contained in descriptors, and these descriptors are "
"typed. For many descriptors the Python representation is simply the "
"corresponding Python type: ``typeText`` in OSA is a Python string, "
"``typeFloat`` is a float, etc. For OSA types that have no direct Python "
"counterpart this module declares classes. Packing and unpacking instances of "
"these classes is handled automatically by :mod:`aepack`."

"An object specifier is essentially an address of an object implemented in an "
"Apple Event server. An Apple Event specifier is used as the direct object "
"for an Apple Event or as the argument of an optional parameter. The :mod:"
"`aetypes` module contains the base classes for OSA classes and properties, "
"which are used by the packages generated by :mod:`gensuitemodule` to "
"populate the classes and properties in a given suite."

"For reasons of backward compatibility, and for cases where you need to "
