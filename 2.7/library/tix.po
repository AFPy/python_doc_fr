"The :mod:`Tix` (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an additional rich "
"set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has many useful widgets, "
"they are far from complete. The :mod:`Tix` library provides most of the "
"commonly needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk: :class:`HList`, :"
"class:`ComboBox`, :class:`Control` (a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment of "
"scrollable widgets. :mod:`Tix` also includes many more widgets that are "
"generally useful in a wide range of applications: :class:`NoteBook`, :class:"
