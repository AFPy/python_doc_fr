"The :mod:`copy_reg` module has been renamed to :mod:`copyreg` in Python 3. "
"The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your "
"sources to Python 3."

"The :mod:`copy_reg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle`, :mod:`cPickle`, and :mod:"
"`copy` modules use those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The "
"module provides configuration information about object constructors which "
"are not classes. Such constructors may be factory functions or class "
"instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "
"(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."

#: ../Doc/library/copy_reg.rst:32
msgid ""
"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*; *type* must not be a \"classic\" class object.  "
"(Classic classes are handled differently; see the documentation for the :mod:"
"`pickle` module for details.)  *function* should return either a string or a "
"tuple containing two or three elements."

"The optional *constructor* parameter, if provided, is a callable object "
"which can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of "
"arguments returned by *function* at pickling time.  :exc:`TypeError` will be "
"raised if *object* is a class or *constructor* is not callable."
