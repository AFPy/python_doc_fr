"The :mod:`test` package is meant for internal use by Python only. It is "

"It is preferred that tests that use the :mod:`unittest` module follow a few "
"guidelines. One is to name the test module by starting it with ``test_`` and "
"end it with the name of the module being tested. The test methods in the "
"test module should start with ``test_`` and end with a description of what "
"the method is testing. This is needed so that the methods are recognized by "
"the test driver as test methods. Also, no documentation string for the "
"method should be included. A comment (such as ``# Tests function returns "
"only True or False``) should be used to provide documentation for test "
"methods. This is done because documentation strings get printed out if they "
"exist and thus what test is being run is not stated."

"The :mod:`test.regrtest` module can be run as a script to drive Python's "
"regression test suite, thanks to the :option:`-m` option: :program:`python -"
"m test.regrtest`. Running the script by itself automatically starts running "
"all regression tests in the :mod:`test` package. It does this by finding all "
"modules in the package whose name starts with ``test_``, importing them, and "
"executing the function :func:`test_main` if present. The names of tests to "
"execute may also be passed to the script. Specifying a single regression "

"Running :mod:`test.regrtest` directly allows what resources are available "

"possible resources: :program:`python -m test.regrtest -uall`. If all but one "
"resource is desired (a more common case), a comma-separated list of "
"resources that are not desired may be listed after ``all``. The command :"
"program:`python -m test.regrtest -uall,-audio,-largefile` will run :mod:"
