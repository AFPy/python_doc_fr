"Compile a source file to byte-code and write out the byte-code cache  file.  "
"The source code is loaded from the file named *file*.  The  byte-code is "
"written to *cfile*, which defaults to *file* ``+`` ``'c'`` (``'o'`` if "
"optimization is enabled in the current interpreter).  If *dfile* is "
"specified, it is used as the name of the source file in error messages "
"instead of *file*.  If *doraise* is true, a :exc:`PyCompileError` is raised "
"when an error is encountered while compiling *file*. If *doraise* is false "
"(the default), an error string is written to ``sys.stderr``, but no "
"exception is raised."

"standard input."
