"The :mod:`textwrap` module provides two convenience functions, :func:`wrap` "
"and :func:`fill`, as well as :class:`TextWrapper`, the class that does all "
"the work, and a utility function  :func:`dedent`.  If you're just wrapping "
"or filling one or two  text strings, the convenience functions should be "
"good enough; otherwise,  you should use an instance of :class:`TextWrapper` "
"for efficiency."

"Both :func:`wrap` and :func:`fill` work by creating a :class:`TextWrapper` "

"(default: ``False``) If true, :class:`TextWrapper` attempts to detect "
"sentence endings and ensure that sentences are always separated by exactly "
"two spaces.  This is generally desired for text in a monospaced font. "
"However, the sentence detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a "
"sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of ``'.'``, "
"``'!'``, or ``'?'``, possibly followed by one of ``'\"'`` or ``\"'\"``, "
"followed by a space.  One problem with this is algorithm is that it is "

"(default: ``True``) If true, then words longer than :attr:`width` will be "
"broken in order to ensure that no lines are longer than :attr:`width`.  If "
"it is false, long words will not be broken, and some lines may be longer "
"than :attr:`width`.  (Long words will be put on a line by themselves, in "
"order to minimize the amount by which :attr:`width` is exceeded.)"

"(default: ``True``) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces "

"false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places for "
"line breaks, but you need to set :attr:`break_long_words` to false if you "
