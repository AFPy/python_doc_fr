"The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module has been merged into :mod:`http.server` in "
"Python 3.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when "
"converting your sources to Python 3."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module defines a request-handler class, interface "
"compatible with :class:`BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` and inherits "
"behavior from :class:`SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` but can "
"also run CGI scripts."

msgid ""
"CGI scripts run by the :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` class cannot execute "
"redirects (HTTP code 302), because code 200 (script output follows) is sent "
"prior to execution of the CGI script.  This pre-empts the status code."

msgid "The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module defines the following class:"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/cgihttpserver.rst:35
msgid ""
"This class is used to serve either files or output of CGI scripts from  the "
"current directory and below. Note that mapping HTTP hierarchic structure to "
"local directory structure is exactly as in :class:`SimpleHTTPServer."
"SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/cgihttpserver.rst:40
msgid ""
"The class will however, run the CGI script, instead of serving it as a file, "
"if it guesses it to be a CGI script. Only directory-based CGI are used --- "
"the other common server configuration is to treat special extensions as "
"denoting CGI scripts."

"The :func:`do_GET` and :func:`do_HEAD` functions are modified to run CGI "
"scripts and serve the output, instead of serving files, if the request leads "
"to somewhere below the ``cgi_directories`` path."
