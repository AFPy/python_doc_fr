"Tk/Tcl has long been an integral part of Python.  It provides a robust and "
"platform independent windowing toolkit, that is available to Python "
"programmers using the :mod:`Tkinter` module, and its extensions, the :mod:"
"`Tix` and the :mod:`ttk` modules."

"The :mod:`Tkinter` module is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. "
"To use :mod:`Tkinter`, you don't need to write Tcl code, but you will need "
"to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl documentation. :"
"mod:`Tkinter` is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk widgets as Python "
"classes.  In addition, the internal module :mod:`_tkinter` provides a "
"threadsafe mechanism which allows Python and Tcl to interact."

":mod:`Tkinter`'s chief virtues are that it is fast, and that it usually "
"comes bundled with Python. Although its standard documentation is weak, good "
"material is available, which includes: references, tutorials, a book and "
"others. :mod:`Tkinter` is also famous for having an outdated look and feel, "
"which has been vastly improved in Tk 8.5. Nevertheless, there are many other "
"GUI libraries that you could be interested in. For more information about "
"alternatives, see the :ref:`other-gui-packages` section."
