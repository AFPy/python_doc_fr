"This module provides functions that exist in 2.x, but have different "
"behavior in Python 3, so they cannot be put into the 2.x builtins namespace."

"Instead, if you want to write code compatible with Python 3 builtins, import "
"them from this module, like this::"

"The :term:`2to3` tool that ports Python 2 code to Python 3 will recognize "
"this usage and leave the new builtins alone."

"The Python 3 :func:`print` function is already in the builtins, but cannot "

"Returns the same as :func:`repr`.  In Python 3, :func:`repr` will return "
"printable Unicode characters unescaped, while :func:`ascii` will always "
"backslash-escape them.  Using :func:`future_builtins.ascii` instead of :func:"
"`repr` in 2.6 code makes it clear that you need a pure ASCII return value."

"Works like the built-in :func:`hex`, but instead of :meth:`__hex__` it will "
"use the :meth:`__index__` method on its argument to get an integer that is "
"then converted to hexadecimal."
