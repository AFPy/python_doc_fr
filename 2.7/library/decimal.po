"Decimal \"is based on a floating-point model which was designed with people "

"Decimal numbers can be represented exactly.  In contrast, numbers like :"
"const:`1.1` and :const:`2.2` do not have exact representations in binary "
"floating point.  End users typically would not expect ``1.1 + 2.2`` to "
"display as :const:`3.3000000000000003` as it does with binary floating point."

"The exactness carries over into arithmetic.  In decimal floating point, "
"``0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3`` is exactly equal to zero.  In binary floating "
"point, the result is :const:`5.5511151231257827e-017`.  While near to zero, "
"the differences prevent reliable equality testing and differences can "
"accumulate. For this reason, decimal is preferred in accounting applications "
"which have strict equality invariants."

#: ../Doc/library/decimal.rst:49
msgid ""
"The decimal module incorporates a notion of significant places so that "
"``1.30 + 1.20`` is :const:`2.50`.  The trailing zero is kept to indicate "
"significance. This is the customary presentation for monetary applications. "
"For multiplication, the \"schoolbook\" approach uses all the figures in the "
"multiplicands.  For instance, ``1.3 * 1.2`` gives :const:`1.56` while ``1.30 "

"Both binary and decimal floating point are implemented in terms of published "
"standards.  While the built-in float type exposes only a modest portion of "

"Signals are groups of exceptional conditions arising during the course of "
