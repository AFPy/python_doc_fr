"One of the most common tasks is to generate the flat text of the email "
"message represented by a message object structure.  You will need to do this "
"if you want to send your message via the :mod:`smtplib` module or the :mod:"
"`nntplib` module, or print the message on the console.  Taking a message "
"object structure and producing a flat text document is the job of the :class:"
"`Generator` class."

"Again, as with the :mod:`email.parser` module, you aren't limited to the "
"functionality of the bundled generator; you could write one from scratch "
"yourself.  However the bundled generator knows how to generate most email in "
"a standards-compliant way, should handle MIME and non-MIME email messages "
"just fine, and is designed so that the transformation from flat text, to a "
"message structure via the :class:`~email.parser.Parser` class, and back to "
"flat text, is idempotent (the input is identical to the output) [#]_.  On "
"the other hand, using the Generator on a :class:`~email.message.Message` "
"constructed by program may result in changes to the :class:`~email.message."
"Message` object as defaults are filled in."

msgid ""
"The constructor for the :class:`Generator` class takes a file-like object "
"called *outfp* for an argument.  *outfp* must support the :meth:`write` "
"method and be usable as the output file in a Python extended print statement."

"Optional *mangle_from_* is a flag that, when ``True``, puts a ``>`` "
"character in front of any line in the body that starts exactly as ``From``, "
"i.e. ``From`` followed by a space at the beginning of the line.  This is the "
"only guaranteed portable way to avoid having such lines be mistaken for a "
"Unix mailbox format envelope header separator (see `WHY THE CONTENT-LENGTH "
"FORMAT IS BAD <https://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html>`_ for details).  "
"*mangle_from_* defaults to ``True``, but you might want to set this to "
"``False`` if you are not writing Unix mailbox format files."

msgid ""
"Optional *maxheaderlen* specifies the longest length for a non-continued "
"header. When a header line is longer than *maxheaderlen* (in characters, "
"with tabs expanded to 8 spaces), the header will be split as defined in the :"
"class:`~email.header.Header` class.  Set to zero to disable header wrapping. "
"The default is 78, as recommended (but not required) by :rfc:`2822`."

"Optional *unixfrom* is a flag that forces the printing of the envelope "
"header delimiter before the first :rfc:`2822` header of the root message "
"object.  If the root object has no envelope header, a standard one is "
"crafted.  By default, this is set to ``False`` to inhibit the printing of "
"the envelope delimiter."
