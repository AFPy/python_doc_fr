"This module provides a nicer interface to the :mod:`_hotshot` C module. "
"Hotshot is a replacement for the existing :mod:`profile` module. As it's "
"written mostly in C, it should result in a much smaller performance impact "
"than the existing :mod:`profile` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/hotshot.rst:20
msgid ""
"The :mod:`hotshot` module focuses on minimizing the overhead while "
"profiling, at the expense of long data post-processing times. For common "
"usage it is recommended to use :mod:`cProfile` instead. :mod:`hotshot` is "
"not maintained and might be removed from the standard library in the future."

"The :mod:`hotshot` profiler does not yet work well with threads. It is "
"useful to use an unthreaded script to run the profiler over the code you're "
"interested in measuring if at all possible."

"The profiler object. The argument *logfile* is the name of a log file to use "
"for logged profile data. The argument *lineevents* specifies whether to "
"generate events for every source line, or just on function call/return. It "
"defaults to ``0`` (only log function call/return). The argument "
"*linetimings* specifies whether to record timing information. It defaults to "
"``1`` (store timing information)."
