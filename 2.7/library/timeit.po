"This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has "
"both a :ref:`timeit-command-line-interface` as well as a :ref:`callable "
"<python-interface>` one.  It avoids a number of common traps for measuring "
"execution times. See also Tim Peters' introduction to the \"Algorithms\" "

"It's tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result "

"case, the lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast your machine can run "
"the given code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not "
"caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other processes interfering "
"with your timing accuracy. So the :func:`min` of the result is probably the "
