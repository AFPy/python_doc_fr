"This module defines a class which can serve as a base for parsing text files "
"formatted in the HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML).  The class is not "
"directly concerned with I/O --- it must be provided with input in string "
"form via a method, and makes calls to methods of a \"formatter\" object in "
"order to produce output.  The :class:`HTMLParser` class is designed to be "
"used as a base class for other classes in order to add functionality, and "
"allows most of its methods to be extended or overridden.  In turn, this "
"class is derived from and extends the :class:`SGMLParser` class defined in "
"module :mod:`sgmllib`.  The :class:`HTMLParser` implementation supports the "
"HTML 2.0 language as described in :rfc:`1866`.  Two implementations of "
"formatter objects are provided in the :mod:`formatter` module; refer to the "
"documentation for that module for information on the formatter interface."

"The interface to feed data to an instance is through the :meth:`feed` "
"method, which takes a string argument.  This can be called with as little or "
"as much text at a time as desired; ``p.feed(a); p.feed(b)`` has the same "
"effect as ``p.feed(a+b)``.  When the data contains complete HTML markup "
"constructs, these are processed immediately; incomplete constructs are saved "
"in a buffer.  To force processing of all unprocessed data, call the :meth:"
"`close` method."

"The interface to define semantics for HTML tags is very simple: derive a "
"class and define methods called :meth:`start_tag`, :meth:`end_tag`, or :meth:"
"`do_tag`. The parser will call these at appropriate moments: :meth:"
"`start_tag` or :meth:`do_tag` is called when an opening tag of the form "
"``<tag ...>`` is encountered; :meth:`end_tag` is called when a closing tag "
"of the form ``<tag>`` is encountered.  If an opening tag requires a "
"corresponding closing tag, like ``<H1>`` ... ``</H1>``, the class should "
"define the :meth:`start_tag` method; if a tag requires no closing tag, like "
"``<P>``, the class should define the :meth:`do_tag` method."
