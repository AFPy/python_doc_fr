msgid ""
"The :mod:`thread` module has been renamed to :mod:`_thread` in Python 3. "
"The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your "
"sources to Python 3; however, you should consider using the high-level :mod:"
"`threading` module instead."

"This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads "
"(also called :dfn:`light-weight processes` or :dfn:`tasks`) --- multiple "
"threads of control sharing their global data space.  For synchronization, "
"simple locks (also called :dfn:`mutexes` or :dfn:`binary semaphores`) are "
"provided. The :mod:`threading` module provides an easier to use and higher-"
"level threading API built on top of this module."

"The module is optional.  It is supported on Windows, Linux, SGI IRIX, "
"Solaris 2.x, as well as on systems that have a POSIX thread (a.k.a. \"pthread"
"\") implementation.  For systems lacking the :mod:`thread` module, the :mod:"
"`dummy_thread` module is available. It duplicates this module's interface "
"and can be used as a drop-in replacement."

"Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The optional "
"*size* argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created "
"threads, and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive "
"integer value of at least 32,768 (32kB). If *size* is not specified, 0 is "
"used. If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, the :exc:`error` "
"exception is raised.  If the specified stack size is invalid, a :exc:"
"`ValueError` is raised and the stack size is unmodified.  32kB is currently "
"the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee sufficient stack space "
"for the interpreter itself.  Note that some platforms may have particular "
"restrictions on values for the stack size, such as requiring a minimum stack "
"size > 32kB or requiring allocation in multiples of the system memory page "
"size - platform documentation should be referred to for more information "
"(4kB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is the "
"suggested approach in the absence of more specific information). "
