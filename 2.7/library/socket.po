"The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system "

"the :func:`.socket` function returns a :dfn:`socket object` whose methods "
"implement the various socket system calls.  Parameter types are somewhat "
"higher-level than in the C interface: as with :meth:`read` and :meth:`write` "
"operations on Python files, buffer allocation on receive operations is "

"Socket addresses are represented as follows: A single string is used for "

"either a hostname in Internet domain notation like ``'daring.cwi.nl'`` or an "
"IPv4 address like ``'100.50.200.5'``, and *port* is an integer. For :const:"
"`AF_INET6` address family, a four-tuple ``(host, port, flowinfo, scopeid)`` "
"is used, where *flowinfo* and *scopeid* represents ``sin6_flowinfo`` and "
"``sin6_scope_id`` member in :const:`struct sockaddr_in6` in C. For :mod:"
"`socket` module methods, *flowinfo* and *scopeid* can be omitted just for "
"backward compatibility. Note, however, omission of *scopeid* can cause "
