"This module contains some convenience routines for file-manipulation on the "
"Macintosh. All file parameters can be specified as pathnames, :class:`FSRef` "
"or :class:`FSSpec` objects.  This module expects a filesystem which supports "
"forked files, so it should not be used on UFS partitions."

"Copy file *src* to *dst*.  If *createpath* is non-zero the folders leading "
"to *dst* are created if necessary. The method copies data and resource fork "
"and some finder information (creator, type, flags) and optionally the "
"creation, modification and backup times (default is to copy them). Custom "
"icons, comments and icon position are not copied."
