"This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files. "

"the ability to compress the audio data."

"Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The "
"sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is "
"sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or "
"quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is "
"the size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of *nchannels*\\*\\ "
"*samplesize* bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of *nchannels*\\*"

"For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses "
