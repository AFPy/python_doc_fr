"The :mod:`mimify` module defines two functions to convert mail messages to "
"and from MIME format.  The mail message can be either a simple message or a "
"so-called multipart message.  Each part is treated separately. Mimifying (a "
"part of) a message entails encoding the message as quoted-printable if it "
"contains any characters that cannot be represented using 7-bit ASCII.  "
"Unmimifying (a part of) a message entails undoing the quoted-printable "
"encoding.  Mimify and unmimify are especially useful when a message has to "
"be edited before being sent.  Typical use would be::"
