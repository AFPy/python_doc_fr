"Usually an IFF-type file consists of one or more chunks.  The proposed usage "

"Class which represents a chunk.  The *file* argument is expected to be a "

"only method that is needed is :meth:`~file.read`.  If the methods :meth:"
"`~file.seek` and :meth:`~file.tell` are present and don't raise an "
"exception, they are also used. If these methods are present and raise an "
"exception, they are expected to not have altered the object.  If the "
"optional argument *align* is true, chunks are assumed to be aligned on 2-"
"byte boundaries.  If *align* is false, no alignment is assumed.  The default "
"value is true.  If the optional argument *bigendian* is false, the chunk "
"size is assumed to be in little-endian order. This is needed for WAVE audio "
"files. The default value is true.  If the optional argument *inclheader* is "
"true, the size given in the chunk header includes the size of the header.  "
