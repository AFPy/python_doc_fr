"The :class:`scheduler` class defines a generic interface to scheduling "
"events. It needs two functions to actually deal with the \"outside world\" "
"--- *timefunc* should be callable without arguments, and return  a number "
"(the \"time\", in any units whatsoever).  The *delayfunc* function should be "
"callable with one argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*, and "
"should delay that many time units. *delayfunc* will also be called with the "
"argument ``0`` after each event is run to allow other threads an opportunity "
"to run in multi-threaded applications."

"In multi-threaded environments, the :class:`scheduler` class has limitations "
"with respect to thread-safety, inability to insert a new task before the one "
"currently pending in a running scheduler, and holding up the main thread "
"until the event queue is empty.  Instead, the preferred approach is to use "
"the :class:`threading.Timer` class instead."

"Schedule a new event. The *time* argument should be a numeric type "
