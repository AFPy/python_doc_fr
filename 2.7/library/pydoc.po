"The :mod:`pydoc` module automatically generates documentation from Python "
"modules.  The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the "
"console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files."

"For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is "
"derived from the docstring (i.e. the :attr:`__doc__` attribute) of the "
"object, and recursively of its documentable members.  If there is no "
"docstring, :mod:`pydoc` tries to obtain a description from the block of "
"comment lines just above the definition of the class, function or method in "
"the source file, or at the top of the module (see :func:`inspect."

"The built-in function :func:`help` invokes the online help system in the "
"interactive interpreter, which uses :mod:`pydoc` to generate its "
"documentation as text on the console.  The same text documentation can also "
"be viewed from outside the Python interpreter by running :program:`pydoc` as "
"a script at the operating system's command prompt. For example, running ::"

"at a shell prompt will display documentation on the :mod:`sys` module, in a "
"style similar to the manual pages shown by the Unix :program:`man` command.  "
"The argument to :program:`pydoc` can be the name of a function, module, or "
"package, or a dotted reference to a class, method, or function within a "
"module or module in a package.  If the argument to :program:`pydoc` looks "
"like a path (that is, it contains the path separator for your operating "
"system, such as a slash in Unix), and refers to an existing Python source "
"file, then documentation is produced for that file."

"In order to find objects and their documentation, :mod:`pydoc` imports the "
"module(s) to be documented.  Therefore, any code on module level will be "
"executed on that occasion.  Use an ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` guard to "
"only execute code when a file is invoked as a script and not just imported."

"When printing output to the console, :program:`pydoc` attempts to paginate "
"the output for easier reading.  If the :envvar:`PAGER` environment variable "

"Specifying a ``-k`` flag before the argument will search the synopsis lines "

"You can also use :program:`pydoc` to start an HTTP server on the local "

"browse the documentation at ``http://localhost:1234/`` in your preferred Web "
"browser. :program:`pydoc -g` will start the server and additionally bring up "
"a small :mod:`Tkinter`\\ -based graphical interface to help you search for "
"documentation pages."

"When :program:`pydoc` generates documentation, it uses the current "
