"2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a "
"series of *fixers* to transform it into valid Python 3.x code.  The standard "
"library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code.  "
"2to3 supporting library :mod:`lib2to3` is, however, a flexible and generic "
"library, so it is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3.  :mod:"

"All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 code points "
"defined in unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each "
"Unicode code point, is to store each code point as four consecutive bytes. "
"There are two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little "
"endian order. These two encodings are called ``UTF-32-BE`` and ``UTF-32-LE`` "
"respectively. Their disadvantage is that if e.g. you use ``UTF-32-BE`` on a "
"little endian machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and "
"decoding. ``UTF-32`` avoids this problem: bytes will always be in natural "
"endianness. When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, "
"then bytes have to be swapped though. To be able to detect the endianness of "
"a ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence, there's the so called BOM (\"Byte "
"Order Mark\"). This is the Unicode character ``U+FEFF``. This character can "
"be prepended to every ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence. The byte "
"swapped version of this character (``0xFFFE``) is an illegal character that "
"may not appear in a Unicode text. So when the first character in an "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence appears to be a ``U+FFFE`` the bytes "
"have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character ``U+FEFF`` had a "
"second purpose as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE``: a character that has no "
"width and doesn't allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give "
"hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using ``U+FEFF`` as a ``ZERO "
"WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` has been deprecated (with ``U+2060`` (``WORD "
"JOINER``) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be "
"able to handle ``U+FEFF`` in both roles: as a BOM it's a device to determine "
"the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence "
"has been decoded into a Unicode string; as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` "

"Most importantly, a good understanding of the Python grammar processed by "

"*Restricted execution* is the basic framework in Python that allows for the "

"within this cell.  The untrusted code cannot break out of its cell, and can "
"only interact with sensitive system resources through interfaces defined and "

"over \"safe-Python\" since true safety is hard to define, and is determined "

"An interesting aspect of Python's restricted execution model is that the "

"because the exact nature of the padded cell is determined by the supervisor, "
"different restrictions can be imposed, depending on the application.  For "
"example, it might be deemed \"safe\" for untrusted code to read any file "
"within a specified directory, but never to write a file.  In this case, the "
"supervisor may redefine the built-in :func:`open` function so that it raises "
"an exception whenever the *mode* parameter is ``'w'``.  It might also "
"perform a :c:func:`chroot`\\ -like operation on the *filename* parameter, "
"such that root is always relative to some safe \"sandbox\" area of the "
"filesystem.  In this case, the untrusted code would still see an built-in :"
"func:`open` function in its environment, with the same calling interface.  "
