"This module allows you to output calendars like the Unix :program:`cal` "
"program, and provides additional useful functions related to the calendar. "
"By default, these calendars have Monday as the first day of the week, and "
"Sunday as the last (the European convention). Use :func:`setfirstweekday` to "
"set the first day of the week to Sunday (6) or to any other weekday.  "
