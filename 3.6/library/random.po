"For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there "

"On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian), "

"Almost all module functions depend on the basic function :func:`.random`, "
"which generates a random float uniformly in the semi-open range [0.0, 1.0).  "
"Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator.  It produces 53-bit "
"precision floats and has a period of 2\\*\\*19937-1.  The underlying "
"implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe.  The Mersenne Twister is "
"one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence.  "
"However, being completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all "
"purposes, and is completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes."
