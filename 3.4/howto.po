msgid ""
"Argument Clinic's primary goal is to take over responsibility for all "
"argument parsing code inside CPython.  This means that, when you convert a "
"function to work with Argument Clinic, that function should no longer do any "
"of its own argument parsing--the code generated by Argument Clinic should be "
"a \"black box\" to you, where CPython calls in at the top, and your code "
"gets called at the bottom, with ``PyObject *args`` (and maybe ``PyObject "
"*kwargs``) magically converted into the C variables and types you need."
msgstr ""

#: howto/clinic.rst:39
msgid ""
"In order for Argument Clinic to accomplish its primary goal, it must be easy "
"to use.  Currently, working with CPython's argument parsing library is a "
"chore, requiring maintaining redundant information in a surprising number of "
"places. When you use Argument Clinic, you don't have to repeat yourself."
msgstr ""

#: howto/clinic.rst:45
msgid ""
"Obviously, no one would want to use Argument Clinic unless it's solving "
"their problem--and without creating new problems of its own. So it's "
"paramount that Argument Clinic generate correct code. It'd be nice if the "
"code was faster, too, but at the very least it should not introduce a major "
"speed regression.  (Eventually Argument Clinic *should* make a major speedup "
"possible--we could rewrite its code generator to produce tailor-made "
"argument parsing code, rather than calling the general-purpose CPython "
"argument parsing library.  That would make for the fastest argument parsing "
"possible!)"
msgstr ""

#: howto/clinic.rst:57

"Additionally, Argument Clinic must be flexible enough to work with any "

"The Zope framework is one of the \"old original\" frameworks.  Its current "

"Database). Because of its highly integrated nature, Zope wound up in a "
"somewhat isolated ecosystem:  code written for Zope wasn't very usable "
