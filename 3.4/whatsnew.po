"The most important of the services now hosted at SourceForge is the Python "

"Python. Previously, there were roughly 7 or so people who had write access "
"to the CVS tree, and all patches had to be inspected and checked in by one "
"of the people on this short list. Obviously, this wasn't very scalable.  By "
"moving the CVS tree to SourceForge, it became possible to grant write access "
"to more people; as of September 2000 there were 27 people able to check in "
"changes, a fourfold increase.  This makes possible large-scale changes that "
"wouldn't be attempted if they'd have to be filtered through the small group "
"of core developers.  For example, one day Peter Schneider-Kamp took it into "
"his head to drop K&R C compatibility and convert the C source for Python to "
"ANSI C. After getting approval on the python-dev mailing list, he launched "
"into a flurry of checkins that lasted about a week, other developers joined "
"in to help, and the job was done.  If there were only 5 people with write "
"access, probably that task would have been viewed as \"nice, but not worth "
"the time and effort needed\" and it would never have gotten done."

"The shift to using SourceForge's services has resulted in a remarkable "

"are tracked in one central location and can be assigned to a specific person "
"for fixing, and we can count the number of open bugs to measure progress.  "
"This didn't come without a cost: developers now have more e-mail to deal "
"with, more mailing lists to follow, and special tools had to be written for "

"In earlier versions, Python's support for implementing comparisons on user- "
"defined classes and extension types was quite simple. Classes could "
"implement a :meth:`__cmp__` method that was given two instances of a class, "
"and could only return 0 if they were equal or +1 or -1 if they weren't; the "
"method couldn't raise an exception or return anything other than a Boolean "
"value.  Users of Numeric Python often found this model too weak and "
"restrictive, because in the number-crunching programs that numeric Python is "
"used for, it would be more useful to be able to perform elementwise "
"comparisons of two matrices, returning a matrix containing the results of a "
"given comparison for each element.  If the two matrices are of different "
"sizes, then the compare has to be able to raise an exception to signal the "
