"For example, the lowest level might define a very low-level set of functions "

"Often, the lowest levels do very simple things; they implement a data "

"Why is this design approach relevant to Python?  Because Python is well "
"suited to functioning as such a glue language.  A common approach is to "
"write a Python module that implements the lower level operations; for the "
"sake of speed, the implementation might be in C, Java, or even Fortran.  "
"Once the primitives are available to Python programs, the logic underlying "

"In *The Mythical Man-Month*, Fredrick Brooks suggests the following rule "
"when planning software projects: \"Plan to throw one away; you will anyway."
"\"  Brooks is saying that the first attempt at a software design often turns "
"out to be wrong; unless the problem is very simple or you're an extremely "
"good designer, you'll find that new requirements and features become "
"apparent once development has actually started.  If these new requirements "
"can't be cleanly incorporated into the program's structure, you're presented "
"with two unpleasant choices: hammer the new features into the program "
"somehow, or scrap everything and write a new version of the program, taking "
"the new features into account from the beginning."

"Python provides you with a good environment for quickly developing an "
"initial prototype.  That lets you get the overall program structure and "
"logic right, and you can fine-tune small details in the fast development "
"cycle that Python provides.  Once you're satisfied with the GUI interface or "
"program output, you can translate the Python code into C++, Fortran, Java, "
"or some other compiled language."

"Prototyping means you have to be careful not to use too many Python features "
"that are hard to implement in your other language.  Using ``eval()``, or "
"regular expressions, or the :mod:`pickle` module, means that you're going to "
"need C or Java libraries for formula evaluation, regular expressions, and "
"serialization, for example.  But it's not hard to avoid such tricky code, "
"and in the end the translation usually isn't very difficult.  The resulting "
"code can be rapidly debugged, because any serious logical errors will have "
"been removed from the prototype, leaving only more minor slip-ups in the "
"translation to track down."
msgstr ""

#: ../src/Doc/howto/advocacy.rst:94
msgid ""
"This strategy builds on the earlier discussion of programmability. Using "
"Python as glue to connect lower-level components has obvious relevance for "
"constructing prototype systems.  In this way Python can help you with "
"development, even if end users never come in contact with Python code at "
"all.  If the performance of the Python version is adequate and corporate "
"politics allow it, you may not need to do a translation into C or Java, but "
"it can still be faster to develop a prototype and then translate it, instead "
"of attempting to produce the final version immediately."

"any Python at all; all the code had been translated into C++.  Even though "

"This is a very common use for Python.  Past conference papers have also "

"Physics Application to Python\" in the references for a good example.  If an "
"algorithm's basic operations are things like \"Take the inverse of this "
"4000x4000 matrix\", and are implemented in some lower-level language, then "
"Python has almost no additional performance cost; the extra time required "
"for Python to evaluate an expression like ``m.invert()`` is dwarfed by the "
"cost of the actual computation. It's particularly good for applications "
"where seemingly endless tweaking is required to get things right. GUI "

"The Python code is also shorter and faster to write (once you're familiar "

"you might waste time trying to patch up what you've got out of a natural "
"reluctance to admit that those two weeks were wasted.  Truthfully, those two "
"weeks haven't been wasted, since you've learnt something about the problem "

"Python is definitely *not* a toy language that's only usable for small "

"However, this expressiveness doesn't come at the cost of an obscure or "

"code, there are relatively few such corners, and proper design can isolate "
"their use to only a few classes or modules.  It's certainly possible to "

"In this sense of the word, Python is quite compact, because the language has "

"namespace called ``math``.  Classes are also namespaces that share many of "
"the properties of modules, and have a few of their own; for example, you can "
"create instances of a class. Instances?  They're yet another namespace.  "

"This simplicity arises from Python's development history.  The language "
