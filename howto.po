"For example, the lowest level might define a very low-level set of functions "

"Often, the lowest levels do very simple things; they implement a data "
"structure such as a binary tree or hash table, or they perform some simple "

"approach, the primitives can be seen as basic building blocks which are then "
"glued together to produce the complete product."

"Why is this design approach relevant to Python?  Because Python is well "
"suited to functioning as such a glue language.  A common approach is to "
"write a Python module that implements the lower level operations; for the "
"sake of speed, the implementation might be in C, Java, or even Fortran.  "
"Once the primitives are available to Python programs, the logic underlying "

"In *The Mythical Man-Month*, Fredrick Brooks suggests the following rule "
"when planning software projects: \"Plan to throw one away; you will anyway."
"\"  Brooks is saying that the first attempt at a software design often turns "
"out to be wrong; unless the problem is very simple or you're an extremely "
"good designer, you'll find that new requirements and features become "
"apparent once development has actually started.  If these new requirements "
"can't be cleanly incorporated into the program's structure, you're presented "
"with two unpleasant choices: hammer the new features into the program "
"somehow, or scrap everything and write a new version of the program, taking "
"the new features into account from the beginning."

"Python provides you with a good environment for quickly developing an "
"initial prototype.  That lets you get the overall program structure and "
"logic right, and you can fine-tune small details in the fast development "
"cycle that Python provides.  Once you're satisfied with the GUI interface or "
"program output, you can translate the Python code into C++, Fortran, Java, "
"or some other compiled language."
msgstr ""

"Prototyping means you have to be careful not to use too many Python features "
"that are hard to implement in your other language.  Using ``eval()``, or "
"regular expressions, or the :mod:`pickle` module, means that you're going to "
"need C or Java libraries for formula evaluation, regular expressions, and "
"serialization, for example.  But it's not hard to avoid such tricky code, "
"and in the end the translation usually isn't very difficult.  The resulting "
"code can be rapidly debugged, because any serious logical errors will have "
"been removed from the prototype, leaving only more minor slip-ups in the "
"translation to track down."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/howto/advocacy.rst:94
msgid ""
"This strategy builds on the earlier discussion of programmability. Using "
"Python as glue to connect lower-level components has obvious relevance for "
"constructing prototype systems.  In this way Python can help you with "
"development, even if end users never come in contact with Python code at "
"all.  If the performance of the Python version is adequate and corporate "
"politics allow it, you may not need to do a translation into C or Java, but "
"it can still be faster to develop a prototype and then translate it, instead "
"of attempting to produce the final version immediately."

"any Python at all; all the code had been translated into C++.  Even though "
"the product doesn't contain a Python interpreter, the Python language has "

"This is a very common use for Python.  Past conference papers have also "

"David M. Beazley and Peter S. Lomdahl's paper \"Feeding a Large-scale "
"Physics Application to Python\" in the references for a good example.  If an "
"algorithm's basic operations are things like \"Take the inverse of this "
"4000x4000 matrix\", and are implemented in some lower-level language, then "
"Python has almost no additional performance cost; the extra time required "
"for Python to evaluate an expression like ``m.invert()`` is dwarfed by the "
"cost of the actual computation. It's particularly good for applications "
"where seemingly endless tweaking is required to get things right. GUI "
"interfaces and Web sites are prime examples."

"The Python code is also shorter and faster to write (once you're familiar "

"was wrong; if you'd spent two weeks working on it instead of just two hours, "
"you might waste time trying to patch up what you've got out of a natural "
"reluctance to admit that those two weeks were wasted.  Truthfully, those two "
"weeks haven't been wasted, since you've learnt something about the problem "
"and the technology you're using to solve it, but it's human nature to view "

"Python is definitely *not* a toy language that's only usable for small "

"However, this expressiveness doesn't come at the cost of an obscure or "
"tricky syntax.  While Python has some dark corners that can lead to obscure "
"code, there are relatively few such corners, and proper design can isolate "
"their use to only a few classes or modules.  It's certainly possible to "
"write confusing code by using too many features with too little concern for "

"In this sense of the word, Python is quite compact, because the language has "
"just a few ideas, which are used in lots of places.  Take namespaces, for "
"example.  Import a module with ``import math``, and you create a new "
"namespace called ``math``.  Classes are also namespaces that share many of "
"the properties of modules, and have a few of their own; for example, you can "
"create instances of a class. Instances?  They're yet another namespace.  "
"Namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, so they have "

"This simplicity arises from Python's development history.  The language "
"syntax derives from different sources; ABC, a relatively obscure teaching "

"information about ABC and Modula-3, consult their respective Web sites at "
"http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/ and http://www.m3.org.)  Other features have "
"come from C, Icon, Algol-68, and even Perl.  Python hasn't really innovated "

"In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", "
"one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor "
"protocol.  Those methods are :meth:`__get__`, :meth:`__set__`, and :meth:"
"`__delete__`.  If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said "
"to be a descriptor."

"The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the "
"attribute from an object's dictionary.  For instance, ``a.x`` has a lookup "
"chain starting with ``a.__dict__['x']``, then ``type(a).__dict__['x']``, and "
"continuing through the base classes of ``type(a)`` excluding metaclasses. If "
"the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, "
"then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor "
"method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which "
"descriptor methods were defined.  Note that descriptors are only invoked for "
"new style objects or classes (a class is new style if it inherits from :"
"class:`object` or :class:`type`)."

"Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. "
"The software's developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that "
"certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message "
"which can optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially "
"different for each occurrence of the event). Events also have an importance "
"which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called "

"`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ is a framework consisting of "
"several tightly coupled elements which were written from scratch and work "
"together very well.  It includes an ORM which is quite powerful while being "
"simple to use, and has a great online administration interface which makes "
"it possible to edit the data in the database with a browser.  The template "
"engine is text-based and is designed to be usable for page designers who "
"cannot write Python.  It supports template inheritance and filters (which "
"work like Unix pipes).  Django has many handy features bundled, such as "
"creation of RSS feeds or generic views, which make it possible to create web "
"sites almost without writing any Python code."

"It has a big, international community, the members of which have created "

"The Zope framework is one of the \"old original\" frameworks.  Its current "
"incarnation in Zope2 is a tightly integrated full-stack framework.  One of "
"its most interesting feature is its tight integration with a powerful object "
"database called the `ZODB <https://launchpad.net/zodb>`_ (Zope Object "
"Database). Because of its highly integrated nature, Zope wound up in a "
"somewhat isolated ecosystem:  code written for Zope wasn't very usable "
"outside of Zope, and vice-versa.  To solve this problem the Zope 3 effort "
"was started.  Zope 3 re-engineers Zope as a set of more cleanly isolated "
"components.  This effort was started before the advent of the WSGI standard, "
"but there is WSGI support for Zope 3 from the `Repoze <http://repoze.org/>`_ "
"project.  Zope components have many years of production use behind them, and "
"the Zope 3 project gives access to these components to the wider Python "
"community.  There is even a separate framework based on the Zope components: "

"Another framework that's already been mentioned is `Pylons`_.  Pylons is "
