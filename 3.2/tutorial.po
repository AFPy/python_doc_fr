"Compared with other programming languages, Python's class mechanism adds "

"class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3.  Python classes provide all the "
"standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance "
"mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any "
"methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a "
"base class with the same name.  Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and "
"kinds of data.  As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic "

"Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be "
"bound to the same object.  This is known as aliasing in other languages.  "
"This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be "
"safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, "
"tuples).  However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the "
"semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, "
"dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of "
"the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects.  For "
"example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the "
"implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, "
"the caller will see the change --- this eliminates the need for two "
"different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal."

"A *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects.  Most namespaces are "
"currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that's normally not "
"noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the "

"functions such as :func:`abs`, and built-in exception names); the global "
"names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation.  In a sense "
"the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace.  The important "
"thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation "
"between names in different namespaces; for instance, two different modules "
"may both define a function ``maximize`` without confusion --- users of the "
"modules must prefix it with the module name."

"The Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals "

"line *after* the first line of the string determines the amount of "
"indentation for the entire documentation string.  (We can't use the first "
"line since it is generally adjacent to the string's opening quotes so its "
"indentation is not apparent in the string literal.)  Whitespace \"equivalent"
"\" to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the "
"string.  Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur "
"all their leading whitespace should be stripped.  Equivalence of whitespace "
"should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally)."
