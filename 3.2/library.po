"2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a "
"series of *fixers* to transform it into valid Python 3.x code.  The standard "
"library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code.  "
"2to3 supporting library :mod:`lib2to3` is, however, a flexible and generic "
"library, so it is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3.  :mod:"

"All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 codepoints defined "
"in Unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each Unicode "
"code point, is to store each codepoint as four consecutive bytes. There are "
"two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little endian order. "
"These two encodings are called ``UTF-32-BE`` and ``UTF-32-LE`` respectively. "
"Their disadvantage is that if e.g. you use ``UTF-32-BE`` on a little endian "
"machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and decoding. "
"``UTF-32`` avoids this problem: bytes will always be in natural endianness. "
"When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, then bytes "
"have to be swapped though. To be able to detect the endianness of a "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence, there's the so called BOM (\"Byte "
"Order Mark\"). This is the Unicode character ``U+FEFF``. This character can "
"be prepended to every ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence. The byte "
"swapped version of this character (``0xFFFE``) is an illegal character that "
"may not appear in a Unicode text. So when the first character in an "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence appears to be a ``U+FFFE`` the bytes "
"have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character ``U+FEFF`` had a "
"second purpose as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE``: a character that has no "
"width and doesn't allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give "
"hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using ``U+FEFF`` as a ``ZERO "
"WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` has been deprecated (with ``U+2060`` (``WORD "
"JOINER``) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be "
"able to handle ``U+FEFF`` in both roles: as a BOM it's a device to determine "
"the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence "
"has been decoded into a string; as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` it's a "
"normal character that will be decoded like any other."

"The :mod:`email` package is a library for managing email messages, including "
"MIME and other :rfc:`2822`\\ -based message documents.  It is specifically "
"*not* designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP (:rfc:`2821`), "
"NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as :mod:"
"`smtplib` and :mod:`nntplib`. The :mod:`email` package attempts to be as RFC-"
"compliant as possible, supporting in addition to :rfc:`2822`, such MIME-"
"related RFCs as :rfc:`2045`, :rfc:`2046`, :rfc:`2047`, and :rfc:`2231`."

"The primary distinguishing feature of the :mod:`email` package is that it "
"splits the parsing and generating of email messages from the internal "
"*object model* representation of email.  Applications using the :mod:`email` "
"package deal primarily with objects; you can add sub-objects to messages, "
"remove sub-objects from messages, completely re-arrange the contents, etc.  "
"There is a separate parser and a separate generator which handles the "
"transformation from flat text to the object model, and then back to flat "
"text again.  There are also handy subclasses for some common MIME object "
"types, and a few miscellaneous utilities that help with such common tasks as "
"extracting and parsing message field values, creating RFC-compliant dates, "
"etc."

"message, this structure is manipulated, and finally, the object tree is "
"rendered back into flat text."

"Most importantly, a good understanding of the Python grammar processed by "

"The ST objects created by :func:`sequence2st` faithfully simulate those "
"structures.  Be aware that the values of the sequences which are considered "

"grammar for the language is revised.  However, transporting code from one "
"Python version to another as source text will always allow correct parse "

"One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a "

"most obvious restriction is that the underlying \"clock\" is only ticking at "
"a rate (typically) of about .001 seconds.  Hence no measurements will be "
"more accurate than the underlying clock.  If enough measurements are taken, "
"then the \"error\" will tend to average out. Unfortunately, removing this "
"first error induces a second source of error."

#: library/profile.rst:509
msgid ""
"The second problem is that it \"takes a while\" from when an event is "
"dispatched until the profiler's call to get the time actually *gets* the "
"state of the clock.  Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the "
"profiler event handler from the time that the clock's value was obtained "
"(and then squirreled away), until the user's code is once again executing.  "
"As a result, functions that are called many times, or call many functions, "
"will typically accumulate this error. The error that accumulates in this "
"fashion is typically less than the accuracy of the clock (less than one "
"clock tick), but it *can* accumulate and become very significant."

"The tar format was originally conceived to make backups on tape drives with "

"are commonly used for file distribution and exchanging archives over "
"networks. One problem of the original format (which is the basis of all "
"other formats) is that there is no concept of supporting different character "
"encodings. For example, an ordinary tar archive created on a *UTF-8* system "
"cannot be read correctly on a *Latin-1* system if it contains non-*ASCII* "
"characters. Textual metadata (like filenames, linknames, user/group names) "
"will appear damaged. Unfortunately, there is no way to autodetect the "
"encoding of an archive. The pax format was designed to solve this problem. "
