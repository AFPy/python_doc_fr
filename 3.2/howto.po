"Programs are often organized in a modular fashion.  Lower-level operations "
"are grouped together, and called by higher-level functions, which may in "
"turn be used as basic operations by still further upper levels."
msgstr ""
"Les programmes sont en général organisés de manière modulaire. Les "
"opérations de bas niveau sont regroupées, et appelées par des fonctions de "
"niveau supérieur, qui peuvent être à leur tour être utilisées comme des "
"opérations unitaires par du code de niveau encore supérieur."

#: howto/advocacy.rst:32
msgid ""
"For example, the lowest level might define a very low-level set of functions "
"for accessing a hash table.  The next level might use hash tables to store "
"the headers of a mail message, mapping a header name like ``Date`` to a "
"value such as ``Tue, 13 May 1997 20:00:54 -0400``.  A yet higher level may "
"operate on message objects, without knowing or caring that message headers "
"are stored in a hash table, and so forth."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:39
msgid ""
"Often, the lowest levels do very simple things; they implement a data "
"structure such as a binary tree or hash table, or they perform some simple "
"computation, such as converting a date string to a number.  The higher "
"levels then contain logic connecting these primitive operations.  Using the "
"approach, the primitives can be seen as basic building blocks which are then "
"glued together to produce the complete product."
msgstr ""
"En général, les niveaux inférieurs réalisent des opérations très simples ; "
"ils implémentent une structure de données comme un arbre binaire ou une "
"table de hachage, ou ils exécutent des opérations simples, comme la "
"conversion d'une date en chaîne de caractères par exemple. Les niveaux "
"supérieurs fournissent la logique pour associer ces opérations primitives. "
"Avec cette approche, les primitives peuvent être considérées comme des "
"simples briques qui sont assemblées afin de construire le produit complet."

#: howto/advocacy.rst:46
msgid ""
"Why is this design approach relevant to Python?  Because Python is well "
"suited to functioning as such a glue language.  A common approach is to "
"write a Python module that implements the lower level operations; for the "
"sake of speed, the implementation might be in C, Java, or even Fortran.  "
"Once the primitives are available to Python programs, the logic underlying "
"higher level operations is written in the form of Python code.  The high-"
"level logic is then more understandable, and easier to modify."

"In *The Mythical Man-Month*, Fredrick Brooks suggests the following rule "
"when planning software projects: \"Plan to throw one away; you will anyway."
"\"  Brooks is saying that the first attempt at a software design often turns "
"out to be wrong; unless the problem is very simple or you're an extremely "
"good designer, you'll find that new requirements and features become "
"apparent once development has actually started.  If these new requirements "
"can't be cleanly incorporated into the program's structure, you're presented "
"with two unpleasant choices: hammer the new features into the program "
"somehow, or scrap everything and write a new version of the program, taking "
"the new features into account from the beginning."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:78
msgid ""
"Python provides you with a good environment for quickly developing an "
"initial prototype.  That lets you get the overall program structure and "
"logic right, and you can fine-tune small details in the fast development "
"cycle that Python provides.  Once you're satisfied with the GUI interface or "
"program output, you can translate the Python code into C++, Fortran, Java, "
"or some other compiled language."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:85
msgid ""
"Prototyping means you have to be careful not to use too many Python features "
"that are hard to implement in your other language.  Using ``eval()``, or "
"regular expressions, or the :mod:`pickle` module, means that you're going to "
"need C or Java libraries for formula evaluation, regular expressions, and "
"serialization, for example.  But it's not hard to avoid such tricky code, "
"and in the end the translation usually isn't very difficult.  The resulting "
"code can be rapidly debugged, because any serious logical errors will have "
"been removed from the prototype, leaving only more minor slip-ups in the "
"translation to track down."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:94
msgid ""
"This strategy builds on the earlier discussion of programmability. Using "
"Python as glue to connect lower-level components has obvious relevance for "
"constructing prototype systems.  In this way Python can help you with "
"development, even if end users never come in contact with Python code at "
"all.  If the performance of the Python version is adequate and corporate "
"politics allow it, you may not need to do a translation into C or Java, but "
"it can still be faster to develop a prototype and then translate it, instead "
"of attempting to produce the final version immediately."

"One example of this development strategy is Microsoft Merchant Server. "
"Version 1.0 was written in pure Python, by a company that subsequently was "
"purchased by Microsoft.  Version 2.0 began to translate the code into C++, "
"shipping with some C++code and some Python code.  Version 3.0 didn't contain "
"any Python at all; all the code had been translated into C++.  Even though "
"the product doesn't contain a Python interpreter, the Python language has "
"still served a useful purpose by speeding up development."

"This is a very common use for Python.  Past conference papers have also "
"described this approach for developing high-level numerical algorithms; see "
"David M. Beazley and Peter S. Lomdahl's paper \"Feeding a Large-scale "
"Physics Application to Python\" in the references for a good example.  If an "
"algorithm's basic operations are things like \"Take the inverse of this "
"4000x4000 matrix\", and are implemented in some lower-level language, then "
"Python has almost no additional performance cost; the extra time required "
"for Python to evaluate an expression like ``m.invert()`` is dwarfed by the "
"cost of the actual computation. It's particularly good for applications "
"where seemingly endless tweaking is required to get things right. GUI "
"interfaces and Web sites are prime examples."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:122
msgid ""
"The Python code is also shorter and faster to write (once you're familiar "
"with Python), so it's easier to throw it away if you decide your approach "
"was wrong; if you'd spent two weeks working on it instead of just two hours, "
"you might waste time trying to patch up what you've got out of a natural "
"reluctance to admit that those two weeks were wasted.  Truthfully, those two "
"weeks haven't been wasted, since you've learnt something about the problem "
"and the technology you're using to solve it, but it's human nature to view "
"this as a failure of some sort."

"Python is definitely *not* a toy language that's only usable for small "
"tasks. The language features are general and powerful enough to enable it to "
"be used for many different purposes.  It's useful at the small end, for 10- "
"or 20-line scripts, but it also scales up to larger systems that contain "
"thousands of lines of code."
msgstr ""

"However, this expressiveness doesn't come at the cost of an obscure or "
"tricky syntax.  While Python has some dark corners that can lead to obscure "
"code, there are relatively few such corners, and proper design can isolate "
"their use to only a few classes or modules.  It's certainly possible to "
"write confusing code by using too many features with too little concern for "
"clarity, but most Python code can look a lot like a slightly-formalized "

"Compact *adj.*  Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all "

"equivalent tool that is not compact. Compactness does not imply triviality "
"or lack of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is "
"more powerful than FORTRAN. Designs become non-compact through accreting "
"features and cruft that don't merge cleanly into the overall design scheme "

"In this sense of the word, Python is quite compact, because the language has "
"just a few ideas, which are used in lots of places.  Take namespaces, for "
"example.  Import a module with ``import math``, and you create a new "
"namespace called ``math``.  Classes are also namespaces that share many of "
"the properties of modules, and have a few of their own; for example, you can "
"create instances of a class. Instances?  They're yet another namespace.  "
"Namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, so they have "
"the same methods as the standard dictionary data type: .keys() returns all "
"the keys, and so forth."
msgstr ""

#: howto/advocacy.rst:174

"This simplicity arises from Python's development history.  The language "
"syntax derives from different sources; ABC, a relatively obscure teaching "
"language, is one primary influence, and Modula-3 is another.  (For more "
"information about ABC and Modula-3, consult their respective Web sites at "
"http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/ and http://www.m3.org.)  Other features have "
"come from C, Icon, Algol-68, and even Perl.  Python hasn't really innovated "

"learn, building on ideas that have been tried in other languages and found "
"useful."

"`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ is a framework consisting of "
"several tightly coupled elements which were written from scratch and work "
"together very well.  It includes an ORM which is quite powerful while being "
"simple to use, and has a great online administration interface which makes "
"it possible to edit the data in the database with a browser.  The template "
"engine is text-based and is designed to be usable for page designers who "
"cannot write Python.  It supports template inheritance and filters (which "
"work like Unix pipes).  Django has many handy features bundled, such as "
"creation of RSS feeds or generic views, which make it possible to create web "
"sites almost without writing any Python code."

"It has a big, international community, the members of which have created "
"many web sites.  There are also a lot of add-on projects which extend "

"Another popular web framework for Python is `TurboGears <http://www."

"For example the ORM and template engine can be changed to use packages "
"different from those used by default."

"The Zope framework is one of the \"old original\" frameworks.  Its current "
"incarnation in Zope2 is a tightly integrated full-stack framework.  One of "
"its most interesting feature is its tight integration with a powerful object "
"database called the `ZODB <https://launchpad.net/zodb>`_ (Zope Object "
"Database). Because of its highly integrated nature, Zope wound up in a "
"somewhat isolated ecosystem:  code written for Zope wasn't very usable "
"outside of Zope, and vice-versa.  To solve this problem the Zope 3 effort "
"was started.  Zope 3 re-engineers Zope as a set of more cleanly isolated "
"components.  This effort was started before the advent of the WSGI standard, "
"but there is WSGI support for Zope 3 from the `Repoze <http://repoze.org/>`_ "
"project.  Zope components have many years of production use behind them, and "
"the Zope 3 project gives access to these components to the wider Python "
"community.  There is even a separate framework based on the Zope components: "
"`Grok <http://grok.zope.org/>`_."

"Another framework that's already been mentioned is `Pylons`_.  Pylons is "
"much like TurboGears, but with an even stronger emphasis on flexibility, "
"which comes at the cost of being more difficult to use.  Nearly every "
"component can be exchanged, which makes it necessary to use the "
"documentation of every single component, of which there are many.  Pylons "
