msgid "Why does Python use indentation for grouping of statements?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:8
msgid ""
"Guido van Rossum believes that using indentation for grouping is extremely "
"elegant and contributes a lot to the clarity of the average Python program. "
"Most people learn to love this feature after a while."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:12
msgid ""
"Since there are no begin/end brackets there cannot be a disagreement between "
"grouping perceived by the parser and the human reader.  Occasionally C "
"programmers will encounter a fragment of code like this::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:21
msgid ""
"Only the ``x++`` statement is executed if the condition is true, but the "
"indentation leads you to believe otherwise.  Even experienced C programmers "
"will sometimes stare at it a long time wondering why ``y`` is being "
"decremented even for ``x > y``."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:26
msgid ""
"Because there are no begin/end brackets, Python is much less prone to coding-"
"style conflicts.  In C there are many different ways to place the braces. If "
"you're used to reading and writing code that uses one style, you will feel "
"at least slightly uneasy when reading (or being required to write) another "
"style."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:31
msgid ""
"Many coding styles place begin/end brackets on a line by themselves.  This "
"makes programs considerably longer and wastes valuable screen space, making "
"it harder to get a good overview of a program.  Ideally, a function should "
"fit on one screen (say, 20-30 lines).  20 lines of Python can do a lot more "
"work than 20 lines of C.  This is not solely due to the lack of begin/end "
"brackets -- the lack of declarations and the high-level data types are also "
"responsible -- but the indentation-based syntax certainly helps."

"and think it is a bug in Python.  It's not.  This has little to do with "

msgid ""
"The :class:`float` type in CPython uses a C ``double`` for storage.  A :"
"class:`float` object's value is stored in binary floating-point with a fixed "
"precision (typically 53 bits) and Python uses C operations, which in turn "
"rely on the hardware implementation in the processor, to perform floating-"
"point operations. This means that as far as floating-point operations are "
"concerned, Python behaves like many popular languages including C and Java."

msgid "Why are Python strings immutable?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:90
msgid "There are several advantages."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:92
msgid ""
"One is performance: knowing that a string is immutable means we can allocate "
"space for it at creation time, and the storage requirements are fixed and "
"unchanging.  This is also one of the reasons for the distinction between "
"tuples and lists."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:97
msgid ""
"Another advantage is that strings in Python are considered as \"elemental\" "
"as numbers.  No amount of activity will change the value 8 to anything else, "
"and in Python, no amount of activity will change the string \"eight\" to "
"anything else."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:105
msgid "Why must 'self' be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:107
msgid ""
"The idea was borrowed from Modula-3.  It turns out to be very useful, for a "
"variety of reasons."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:110
msgid ""
"First, it's more obvious that you are using a method or instance attribute "
"instead of a local variable.  Reading ``self.x`` or ``self.meth()`` makes it "
"absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you "
"don't know the class definition by heart.  In C++, you can sort of tell by "
"the lack of a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or "
"easily recognizable) -- but in Python, there are no local variable "
"declarations, so you'd have to look up the class definition to be sure.  "
"Some C++ and Java coding standards call for instance attributes to have an "
"``m_`` prefix, so this explicitness is still useful in those languages, too."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:120
msgid ""
"Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to "
"explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class.  In C++, if "
"you want to use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived "
"class, you have to use the ``::`` operator -- in Python you can write "
"``baseclass.methodname(self, <argument list>)``.  This is particularly "
"useful for :meth:`__init__` methods, and in general in cases where a derived "
"class method wants to extend the base class method of the same name and thus "
"has to call the base class method somehow."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:129
msgid ""
"Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with "
"assignment: since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those "
"variables to which a value is assigned in a function body (and that aren't "
"explicitly declared global), there has to be some way to tell the "
"interpreter that an assignment was meant to assign to an instance variable "
"instead of to a local variable, and it should preferably be syntactic (for "
"efficiency reasons).  C++ does this through declarations, but Python doesn't "
"have declarations and it would be a pity having to introduce them just for "
"this purpose.  Using the explicit ``self.var`` solves this nicely.  "
"Similarly, for using instance variables, having to write ``self.var`` means "
"that references to unqualified names inside a method don't have to search "
"the instance's directories.  To put it another way, local variables and "
"instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need to tell "
"Python which namespace to use."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:145
msgid "Why can't I use an assignment in an expression?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:147
msgid ""
"Many people used to C or Perl complain that they want to use this C idiom:"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:155
msgid "where in Python you're forced to write this::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:163
msgid ""
"The reason for not allowing assignment in Python expressions is a common, "
"hard-to-find bug in those other languages, caused by this construct:"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:175
msgid ""
"The error is a simple typo: ``x = 0``, which assigns 0 to the variable "
"``x``, was written while the comparison ``x == 0`` is certainly what was "
"intended."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:178
msgid ""
"Many alternatives have been proposed.  Most are hacks that save some typing "
"but use arbitrary or cryptic syntax or keywords, and fail the simple "
"criterion for language change proposals: it should intuitively suggest the "
"proper meaning to a human reader who has not yet been introduced to the "
"construct."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:183
msgid ""
"An interesting phenomenon is that most experienced Python programmers "
"recognize the ``while True`` idiom and don't seem to be missing the "
"assignment in expression construct much; it's only newcomers who express a "
"strong desire to add this to the language."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:188
msgid ""
"There's an alternative way of spelling this that seems attractive but is "
"generally less robust than the \"while True\" solution::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:196
msgid ""
"The problem with this is that if you change your mind about exactly how you "
"get the next line (e.g. you want to change it into ``sys.stdin.readline()``) "
"you have to remember to change two places in your program -- the second "
"occurrence is hidden at the bottom of the loop."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:201
msgid ""
"The best approach is to use iterators, making it possible to loop through "
"objects using the ``for`` statement.  For example, :term:`file objects <file "
"object>` support the iterator protocol, so you can write simply::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:211
msgid ""
"Why does Python use methods for some functionality (e.g. list.index()) but "
"functions for other (e.g. len(list))?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:213
msgid ""
"The major reason is history. Functions were used for those operations that "
"were generic for a group of types and which were intended to work even for "
"objects that didn't have methods at all (e.g. tuples).  It is also "
"convenient to have a function that can readily be applied to an amorphous "
"collection of objects when you use the functional features of Python "
"(``map()``, ``zip()`` et al)."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:219
msgid ""
"In fact, implementing ``len()``, ``max()``, ``min()`` as a built-in function "
"is actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type.  One "
"can quibble about individual cases but it's a part of Python, and it's too "
"late to make such fundamental changes now. The functions have to remain to "
"avoid massive code breakage."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:229
msgid ""
"For string operations, Python has moved from external functions (the "
"``string`` module) to methods.  However, ``len()`` is still a function."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:234
msgid "Why is join() a string method instead of a list or tuple method?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:236
msgid ""
"Strings became much more like other standard types starting in Python 1.6, "
"when methods were added which give the same functionality that has always "
"been available using the functions of the string module.  Most of these new "
"methods have been widely accepted, but the one which appears to make some "
"programmers feel uncomfortable is::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:244
msgid "which gives the result::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:248
msgid "There are two common arguments against this usage."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:250
msgid ""
"The first runs along the lines of: \"It looks really ugly using a method of "
"a string literal (string constant)\", to which the answer is that it might, "
"but a string literal is just a fixed value. If the methods are to be allowed "
"on names bound to strings there is no logical reason to make them "
"unavailable on literals."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:256
msgid ""
"The second objection is typically cast as: \"I am really telling a sequence "
"to join its members together with a string constant\".  Sadly, you aren't.  "
"For some reason there seems to be much less difficulty with having :meth:"
"`~str.split` as a string method, since in that case it is easy to see that ::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:263
msgid ""
"is an instruction to a string literal to return the substrings delimited by "
"the given separator (or, by default, arbitrary runs of white space)."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:266
msgid ""
":meth:`~str.join` is a string method because in using it you are telling the "
"separator string to iterate over a sequence of strings and insert itself "
"between adjacent elements.  This method can be used with any argument which "
"obeys the rules for sequence objects, including any new classes you might "
"define yourself. Similar methods exist for bytes and bytearray objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "How fast are exceptions?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:276
msgid ""
"A try/except block is extremely efficient if no exceptions are raised.  "
"Actually catching an exception is expensive.  In versions of Python prior to "
"2.0 it was common to use this idiom::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:286
msgid ""
"This only made sense when you expected the dict to have the key almost all "
"the time.  If that wasn't the case, you coded it like this::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:294
msgid ""
"For this specific case, you could also use ``value = dict.setdefault(key, "
"getvalue(key))``, but only if the ``getvalue()`` call is cheap enough "
"because it is evaluated in all cases."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:300
msgid "Why isn't there a switch or case statement in Python?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:302
msgid ""
"You can do this easily enough with a sequence of ``if... elif... elif... "
"else``. There have been some proposals for switch statement syntax, but "
"there is no consensus (yet) on whether and how to do range tests.  See :pep:"
"`275` for complete details and the current status."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:307
msgid ""
"For cases where you need to choose from a very large number of "
"possibilities, you can create a dictionary mapping case values to functions "
"to call.  For example::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:321
msgid ""
"For calling methods on objects, you can simplify yet further by using the :"
"func:`getattr` built-in to retrieve methods with a particular name::"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:333
msgid ""
"It's suggested that you use a prefix for the method names, such as "
"``visit_`` in this example.  Without such a prefix, if values are coming "
"from an untrusted source, an attacker would be able to call any method on "
"your object."

"Can't you emulate threads in the interpreter instead of relying on an OS-"
"specific thread implementation?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:341
msgid ""
"Answer 1: Unfortunately, the interpreter pushes at least one C stack frame "
"for each Python stack frame.  Also, extensions can call back into Python at "
"almost random moments.  Therefore, a complete threads implementation "
"requires thread support for C."

msgid "Why can't lambda expressions contain statements?"
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:353
msgid ""
"Python lambda expressions cannot contain statements because Python's "
"syntactic framework can't handle statements nested inside expressions.  "
"However, in Python, this is not a serious problem.  Unlike lambda forms in "
"other languages, where they add functionality, Python lambdas are only a "
"shorthand notation if you're too lazy to define a function."
msgstr ""

#: faq/design.rst:359
msgid ""
"Functions are already first class objects in Python, and can be declared in "
"a local scope.  Therefore the only advantage of using a lambda instead of a "
"locally-defined function is that you don't need to invent a name for the "

"Not trivially.  Python's high level data types, dynamic typing of objects "
"and run-time invocation of the interpreter (using :func:`eval` or :func:"

msgid "How does Python manage memory?"

#: faq/design.rst:401
msgid ""
"The details of Python memory management depend on the implementation.  The "
"standard implementation of Python, :term:`CPython`, uses reference counting "
"to detect inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to collect reference "
"cycles, periodically executing a cycle detection algorithm which looks for "
"inaccessible cycles and deletes the objects involved. The :mod:`gc` module "

#: faq/design.rst:409
msgid ""
"Other implementations (such as `Jython <http://www.jython.org>`_ or `PyPy "

#: faq/design.rst:427

"For one thing, this is not a C standard feature and hence it's not portable. "
"(Yes, we know about the Boehm GC library.  It has bits of assembler code for "

"Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in "

"Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages.  They "

"Dictionaries work by computing a hash code for each key stored in the "

"you're storing keys that all have different hash values, this means that "
"dictionaries take constant time -- O(1), in computer science notation -- to "
"retrieve a key.  It also means that no sorted order of the keys is "

"The hash table implementation of dictionaries uses a hash value calculated "
