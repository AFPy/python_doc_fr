"The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has "
"already been reported.  The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the "
"developers time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be "
"that the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional "
"information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you "
"can!). To do this, search the bug database using the search box on the top "
"of the page."
