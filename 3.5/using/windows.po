"primarily intended to add a per-user installation of Python, with the core "
"interpreter and library being used by a single user. The installer is also "

"The simpler approach is to provide a batch file or generated shortcut that "

"Python and not its actual name, and users may have trouble distinguishing it "

"With the latter approach, packages should be installed as directories "

"Applications written in native code often require some form of scripting "

"In general, the majority of the application is in native code, and some part "
"will either invoke ``python.exe`` or directly use ``python3.dll``. For "
"either case, extracting the embedded distribution to a subdirectory of the "
"application installation is sufficient to provide a loadable Python "
"interpreter."

"As with the application use, packages can be installed to any location as "
