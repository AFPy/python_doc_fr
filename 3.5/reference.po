"Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and ``::"

"repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (``+``) means one or "
"more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets (``[ ]``) means "
"zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional).  "
