"One of the most common tasks is to generate the flat text of the email "
"message represented by a message object structure.  You will need to do this "
"if you want to send your message via the :mod:`smtplib` module or the :mod:"
"`nntplib` module, or print the message on the console.  Taking a message "
"object structure and producing a flat text document is the job of the :class:"
"`Generator` class."

"Again, as with the :mod:`email.parser` module, you aren't limited to the "
"functionality of the bundled generator; you could write one from scratch "
"yourself.  However the bundled generator knows how to generate most email in "
"a standards-compliant way, should handle MIME and non-MIME email messages "
"just fine, and is designed so that the transformation from flat text, to a "
"message structure via the :class:`~email.parser.Parser` class, and back to "
"flat text, is idempotent (the input is identical to the output) [#]_.  On "
"the other hand, using the Generator on a :class:`~email.message.Message` "
"constructed by program may result in changes to the :class:`~email.message."
