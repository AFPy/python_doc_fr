"tree as of May 2000, with the most significant new feature being Unicode "
"support.  Development continued after May, of course, so the 1.6 tree "

"The most important of the services now hosted at SourceForge is the Python "

"Python. Previously, there were roughly 7 or so people who had write access "
"to the CVS tree, and all patches had to be inspected and checked in by one "
"of the people on this short list. Obviously, this wasn't very scalable.  By "
"moving the CVS tree to SourceForge, it became possible to grant write access "
"to more people; as of September 2000 there were 27 people able to check in "
"changes, a fourfold increase.  This makes possible large-scale changes that "
"wouldn't be attempted if they'd have to be filtered through the small group "
"of core developers.  For example, one day Peter Schneider-Kamp took it into "
"his head to drop K&R C compatibility and convert the C source for Python to "
"ANSI C. After getting approval on the python-dev mailing list, he launched "
"into a flurry of checkins that lasted about a week, other developers joined "
"in to help, and the job was done.  If there were only 5 people with write "

"are tracked in one central location and can be assigned to a specific person "
"for fixing, and we can count the number of open bugs to measure progress.  "
"This didn't come without a cost: developers now have more e-mail to deal "
