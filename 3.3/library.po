"2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a "
"series of *fixers* to transform it into valid Python 3.x code.  The standard "
"library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code.  "
"2to3 supporting library :mod:`lib2to3` is, however, a flexible and generic "
"library, so it is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3.  :mod:"

"All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 codepoints defined "
"in Unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each Unicode "
"code point, is to store each codepoint as four consecutive bytes. There are "
"two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little endian order. "
"These two encodings are called ``UTF-32-BE`` and ``UTF-32-LE`` respectively. "
"Their disadvantage is that if e.g. you use ``UTF-32-BE`` on a little endian "
"machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and decoding. "
"``UTF-32`` avoids this problem: bytes will always be in natural endianness. "
"When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, then bytes "
"have to be swapped though. To be able to detect the endianness of a "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence, there's the so called BOM (\"Byte "
"Order Mark\"). This is the Unicode character ``U+FEFF``. This character can "
"be prepended to every ``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence. The byte "
"swapped version of this character (``0xFFFE``) is an illegal character that "
"may not appear in a Unicode text. So when the first character in an "
"``UTF-16`` or ``UTF-32`` byte sequence appears to be a ``U+FFFE`` the bytes "
"have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character ``U+FEFF`` had a "
"second purpose as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE``: a character that has no "
"width and doesn't allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give "
"hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using ``U+FEFF`` as a ``ZERO "
"WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` has been deprecated (with ``U+2060`` (``WORD "
"JOINER``) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be "
"able to handle ``U+FEFF`` in both roles: as a BOM it's a device to determine "
"the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence "
"has been decoded into a string; as a ``ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE`` it's a "
"normal character that will be decoded like any other."

"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like :"
"term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places "
"where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the :mod:"
"`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also change a "
"single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence by "
"assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and write "
"data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through the "
"file to different positions."

"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`mmap` constructor, which is "
"different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide a file "
"descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an existing "
"Python file object, use its :meth:`fileno` method to obtain the correct "
"value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can open the file using "
"the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor directly (the "
"file still needs to be closed when done)."

"If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you "

"that local modifications to the buffers are actually available to the "
"mapping."

"For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may be "

"to specify read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively. "
"*access* can be used on both Unix and Windows.  If *access* is not "
"specified, Windows mmap returns a write-through mapping.  The initial memory "
"values for all three access types are taken from the specified file.  "
"Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` memory map raises a :exc:`TypeError` "

":dfn:`Deterministic profiling` is meant to reflect the fact that all "
"*function call*, *function return*, and *exception* events are monitored, "
"and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during "
"which time the user's code is executing).  In contrast, :dfn:`statistical "
"profiling` (which is not done by this module) randomly samples the effective "
"instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent.  The latter "
"technique traditionally involves less overhead (as the code does not need to "
"be instrumented), but provides only relative indications of where time is "
"being spent."
msgstr ""

#: library/profile.rst:505
msgid ""
"In Python, since there is an interpreter active during execution, the "
"presence of instrumented code is not required to do deterministic "
"profiling.  Python automatically provides a :dfn:`hook` (optional callback) "
"for each event.  In addition, the interpreted nature of Python tends to add "
"so much overhead to execution, that deterministic profiling tends to only "
"add small processing overhead in typical applications.  The result is that "

"time statistics about the execution of a Python program."

msgstr ""

#: library/profile.rst:529
msgid ""
"One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a "
"fundamental problem with deterministic profilers involving accuracy.  The "
"most obvious restriction is that the underlying \"clock\" is only ticking at "
"a rate (typically) of about .001 seconds.  Hence no measurements will be "
"more accurate than the underlying clock.  If enough measurements are taken, "
"then the \"error\" will tend to average out. Unfortunately, removing this "
"first error induces a second source of error."
msgstr ""

#: library/profile.rst:537
msgid ""
"The second problem is that it \"takes a while\" from when an event is "
"dispatched until the profiler's call to get the time actually *gets* the "
"state of the clock.  Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the "
"profiler event handler from the time that the clock's value was obtained "
"(and then squirreled away), until the user's code is once again executing.  "
"As a result, functions that are called many times, or call many functions, "
"will typically accumulate this error. The error that accumulates in this "
"fashion is typically less than the accuracy of the clock (less than one "
"clock tick), but it *can* accumulate and become very significant."

"calibrated, it will be more accurate (in a least square sense), but it will "
"sometimes produce negative numbers (when call counts are exceptionally low, "

"The tar format was originally conceived to make backups on tape drives with "
"the main focus on preserving file system information. Nowadays tar archives "
"are commonly used for file distribution and exchanging archives over "
"networks. One problem of the original format (which is the basis of all "
"other formats) is that there is no concept of supporting different character "
"encodings. For example, an ordinary tar archive created on a *UTF-8* system "
"cannot be read correctly on a *Latin-1* system if it contains non-*ASCII* "
"characters. Textual metadata (like filenames, linknames, user/group names) "
"will appear damaged. Unfortunately, there is no way to autodetect the "
"encoding of an archive. The pax format was designed to solve this problem. "

"The packer is one of Tk's geometry-management mechanisms.    Geometry "
"managers are used to specify the relative positioning of the positioning of "

"more cumbersome *placer* (which is used less commonly, and we do not cover "
